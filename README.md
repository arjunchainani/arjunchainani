## Hi, I'm Arjun Chainani 👋

📖 I'm an undergraduate studying **Computer Engineering** at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**.
👨‍💻 I'm experienced in and deeply passionate about machine learning, space/astronomy, and robotics, and I'm eager to continue diving into the applications of intelligent systems, especially for outer space environments!
🔭 I'm currently working as a computational astrophysics research intern for the Champaign Supernova Team and the NCSA Gravity Group at Illinois' National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA).
